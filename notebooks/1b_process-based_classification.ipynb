    "# 1b: Process-based coastal classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the second notebook of week 1. In the previous notebook, you have looked at tectonic classification. We now continue with process-based coastal classification. In this notebook, we will explore several coastal systems around the world considering the second- and third-order scale of features (i.e., at regional $O$(10-100km) and local $O$(0.1-1km) scales).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 2 of the [Coastal Dynamics Open Textbook](https://books.open.tudelft.nl/home/catalog/book/202), it is explained how coastal systems can be classified according to the processes that influence these systems. For example, one of the figures (below) shows how the relative influence of fluvial, wave and tidal processes determines the shape of coastal features. The goal of this notebook exercise is that you can identify the signatures of the processes that are introduced in Chapter 2 in several coastal systems around the world. Looking at remotely-sensed (satellite or aerial) images of coastal systems and interpreting which physical processes shape the coast is an important skill for the modern coastal engineer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will first prepare the visualization of the coastal systems. Next, you will be asked to answer 13 questions, mainly multiple-choice or multiple-selection questions, and 1 numeric question.\n",

    "Please note that time always plays a role in classification. A previously sediment-rich system for instance, may be sediment-poor in current times. Systems may also show relict features from the past when there was a different balance between physical processes. For example, you can find beach/dune relicts in barrier islands on the rim of the Mississippi delta system (Figure 2.46 in the textbook). These islands date back to a previous era with larger sediment supply."

    "### Question block 1: characterizing Individual Coastal Systems\n",
    "One of the most useful skills that a modern coastal engineer can have is being able to interpret satellite imagery. What can we learn about coasts from remote sensing? How can we apply what we learned in Chapter 2 about coastal classification? When you look at these images, consider the following checklist:\n",
    " - Where is your site with respect to plate boundaries? (leading, trailing)\n",
    " - Is there evidence of past RSLR rise, fall, or stability?\n",
    " - Is there evidence of past glaciation?\n",
    " - What are the dominant hydrodynamic processes and sediment sources (wave/tide/river)?\n",
    " - Primary/secondary coastal forms? (See Table 2.3)\n",
    " - What kind of sediment is present (sand/mud/other)? How much?\n",
    " - What kind of biotic or human influences do you see?\n",
    " - Is the coast prograding or retreating?\n",

Have a look at the system mentioned in the questions below, then try to answer the questions based on the satellite images and what you have learned so far.
