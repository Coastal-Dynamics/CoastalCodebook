First, both the onshore directed short-wave term and the offshore directed long-wave term increase when the waves are shoaling until point of breaking. Based on this you may guess a width of 12.5 to 13 m. Now remember that we are dealing with irregular waves and that we are after the point of initial breaking (where the highest waves break). This will thus be a bit further seaward, at say 15 m from the waterline. Second, the undertow contribution is more or less restricted to the surf zone (with nonzero velocties also outside and the maximum inside the surf zone). That the maximum at around 12 m can partly be attributed to a delay in the conversion of organized wave energy into turbulent motion (you will learn more about this in the B module).",
