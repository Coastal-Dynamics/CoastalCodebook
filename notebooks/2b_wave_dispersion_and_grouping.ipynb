    "Welcome to the second of the four notebooks that you can practice with this week. It deals with wave dispersion and grouping. If you have succesfully taken the Waves Unit, these topics should not have many secrets to you anymore. If this is indeed the case, you could either choose to skip this notebook or use it as a refresher. If you have not taken Waves, you can use this notebook (and the more basic Notebook 2a, if necessary) to get you up-to-speed with the prerequisite knowledge for Coastal Systems. In Coastal Systems, we will not examine this knowledge separately. We will however build on it, and as such, (small) parts of it may come back in the examination. \n",

    "### Theory \n",
    "\n",
    "The linear dispersion relation relates the wave frequency $\\omega=2\\pi/T$ and the wavenumber $k=2\\pi/L$, through the water depth $h$. It holds for small-amplitude waves and read as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\tag{2}\n",
    "\\omega = \\sqrt{gk tanh(kh)} \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also find it in this form [try to rewrite (2) to obtain (3)]:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\tag{3}\n",
    "L = \\frac{g}{2\\pi}T^2 tanh(2\\pi\\frac{h}{L}) \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "For known $h$ and wave length $L$ (or, equivalently, $k$), it is straightforward to find the wave period $T$ (or, equivalently, $\\omega$). However, generally $h$ and $T$ would be known instead and we would end up with an implicit equation in $k$ or $L$. There are a few methods to solve this implicit equation:\n",
    "1. Use Table A.3 of the [Coastal Dynamics Open Textbook](https://books.open.tudelft.nl/home/catalog/book/202)\n",
    "2. Use the explicit approximation of Fenton (Equation 5.4.20 in Ocean Waves by Leo Holthuijsen)\n",
    "3. Use an iterative procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have no idea at all how to apply these methods, you could first step back to Notebook 2a on Preknowledge Waves, where you can try all three methods. If you are sufficiently familiar with the methods (we assume you are, since you have followed Waves!), you can continue with this notebook 2b.  From here on, we will only use explicit approximation of Fenton (Equation 5.4.20 in Ocean Waves by Leo Holthuijsen) and the deep and shallow water approximations. In Waves you should have programmed a Python function for the Fenton solution. We will use that here!\n",
    "\n",
    "Both for large and small $kh$, the dispersion relationship can be simplified to explicit expressions that can be solved without iterations. *You should be able to find and use these simplified equations in an exam situation (see for instance Table A.3 and Section 3.5.2. in the textbook).* Note that the simplified equations are also summarized in Notebook 2a.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "Here, we will to apply the dispersion relationship to tsunami waves, following the exercise as described in footnote 2 on page 114 of the textbook. Tsunami periods range from 5 to 60 minutes. We assume a water depth of 4000 m. \n",

    "- Question A: What is the wave period range for which this depth of $h$ = 4000 m is classified as intermediate water? In the following, we will refer to the periods that correspond to the deep and shallow water limits of this wave period range as $T_2$ and $T_3$, respectively. \n",
    "- Question B: What is the range in wave lengths for tsunami waves at this water depth? Let's assign the variable name $T_1$ and $T_4$ to the lower and upper bound of the tsunami wave period range, so $T_1$ = 300 s and $T_4$ = 3600 s. We will refer to the corresponding wave lengths as $L_1$ and $L_4$, respectively. \n",

    "\n",
    "Or, in other words, compute $T_2$ and $T_3$. Also compute $L_2$ and $L_3$ (you will need these later). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do these computations in two ways: \n",
    "1. First we use the shallow and deep water approximations\n",
    "1. Next we use the full dispersion relationship (in the Fenton approximation)\n",
