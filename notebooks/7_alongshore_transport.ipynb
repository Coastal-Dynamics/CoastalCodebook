    "# 7: Alongshore transport\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the notebook of week 7! Just as in week 6, we only have a single notebook this week. The main topic of this notebook is alongshore sediment transport, which is described in Chapter 8 of the [Coastal Dynamics Open Textbook](https://books.open.tudelft.nl/home/catalog/book/202). This notebook consists of three parts:\n",
    "1. In part 1, we will look into the CERC formula, and how to use it to obtain an (S, $\\phi$)-curve (Sections 8.2.3-8.2.4).\n",
    "2. Afterwards, in part 2, we will use the (S, $\\phi$)-curve to determine coastal evolution around a breakwater (Sections 8.3.2-8.3.3).\n",
    "3. In part 3, we will consider a transport curve as computed in a coastline model (Intermezzo 8.2)\n",
    "\n",
    "You do *not* have to code yourself in this notebook. Instead, the challenge for you is to read through the notebook - including  the code - and see if you can follow along. There are eleven multiple-choice / -selection questions, and six numerical questions for you to check your understanding. The code uses the dispersion relationship, for which we provide an efficient solver. You can also replace it by your own dispersion relation, as you have coded it in previous notebooks."

    "## Part 1: CERC formula and ($S$,$\\phi$)-curve\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Many different formulas exist to calculate bulk longshore sediment transport. One widely used formula is the CERC formula, which in its most general form is shown in the textbook as Equation 8.4 in the book. Under the assumption of shallow-water wave breaking, we can write the CERC formula as follows (Equation 8.5 in the textbook): \n",
    "\n",
    "$$S = \\frac{K}{16(s-1)(1-p)} \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{\\gamma}} \\sin{2 \\phi_b} H_b^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a complete description of each parameter, see Section 8.2.3 of the book. As you can see the alongshore transport is here written in terms of the wave angle $\\phi_b$ and wave height at breaking $H_b$. If all parameters - including **the wave height at breaking** $H_b$ - are kept constant, the transport magnitude is maximum at $\\phi_b$ = 45°. In practice $\\phi_b$ is in the range -20° to -20° due to refraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is more practical to use deep-water wave parameters in the equations. For straight and parallel depth contours, the textbook presents the following version of the CERC formula (Equation 8.10 in the book):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S = \\frac{K}{32(s-1)(1-p)} c_b \\sin{2 \\phi_0} H_0^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that it uses deep-water values for the wave height $H_0$ and wave angle $\\phi_0$, but needs the wave celerity at breaking $c_b$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 8.1 in the textbook\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 8.1 in the book examines the effect of the angle of wave incidence on longshore sediment transport for straight and parallel depth contours. It does so by using Equation 8.10 for a constant offshore wave height and period and a range of deep water angles of attack $\\phi_0$. In this notebook, you can discover in more detail how the calculations are done. \n",
    "\n",
    "In line with Example 8.1 in the book, we will assume that the offshore wave height $H_0$ is equal to the deep-water root-mean-square wave height $H_{rms,0}$, and can be represented by a single value of 2 m, with a period T of 7 s. The corresponding value for $K$ is given by $K_{rms} \\approx 0.7$. We further use a porosity $p = 0.4$ and relative density $s = 2.65$. We use a breaker index of $\\gamma = H_{rms,b}/h_b = 0.8$, where $H_{rms,b}$ is the root-mean-square wave height at breaking and $h_b$ is the water depth at the breaking point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the constant offshore wave height, the only variables left in the CERC formula are the wave celerity at breaking $c_b$ and the offshore wave angle $\\phi_0$. Starting from our values for $H_0$ and $T$, we can use linear wave theory to compute values for $c_b$ as a function of $\\phi_0$. In order to determine $c_b$, we need to know $h_b$. This requires an iterative computation procedure, which is described in Example 8.1 in the book. In short, the steps in a by-hand computation would be: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Guess $h_b$\n",
    "1. Compute $c_b$ from linear wave theory (this requires solving the dispersion relationship, see notebooks 2a and 2b)\n",
    "2. Compute the shoaling and refraction coefficients and, from those, $H_b$\n",
    "3. Compute $h_b=H_b/\\gamma$ and check whether this is equal to the guess for $h_b$.\n",
    "4. If not, make a better estimate for $h_b$ and repeat\n"

    "\n",
    "According to the single-line theory described in Section 8.3.2, we know the coastline will evolve by (Equation 8.16):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{d} \\frac{\\partial S_x}{\\partial x}=0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $S_x$ the sediment transport in the $x$-direction (the alongshore coordinate), $y = Y$ the coastline position and $d$ the active profile height. We define the transport $S_x$ positive in positive x-direction. This equation shows that the temporal evolution of the coastline position $Y$ is determined by the *alongshore gradient* of the alongshore transport. The equation requires that $S_x$ is defined as a bulk volume transport of *deposited material*, hence including pores (verify this!). Our formulation of the CERC formula satisfies this requirement. \n",
    "\n",
    "For any location $x$ along the coastline and a given active profile height $d$, we can determine the coastline evolution through the following steps:\n",
    "1. Determine the local deep water angle of wave attack relative to the coastline $\\phi$ \n",
    "2. Determine the sediment transport, which is a function of this local angle $\\phi$ (see Part 1)\n",
    "3. Determine the alongshore gradient of the alongshore sediment transport $\\partial S_x/\\partial x$\n",
    "4. Determine the expected morphological change in a certain short time interval $\\partial Y/\\partial t$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when the coastline orientation changes, the angle of wave attack relative to the coastline changes as well and so too does the transport. We thus need to iterate through these steps. This is called the *morphological feedback loop*. When repeated, for example through a numerical model, this strategy can help predict morphological changes. This is useful for predicting the shoreline evolution due to for instance human interventions, like the construction of harbours or coastal protection works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us for example consider a breakwater perpendicular to the shore. We will try to use a numerical model to determine the shoreline evolution. Don't worry too much about the numerical model -- for now, we will focus on the physical concepts. Therefore, and because it may take a little while to run, we have run the model already for you, and will simply load the results. You will learn more about the numerical modelling part in the *Coastal Modelling* unit of the Coastal Engineering B-module (CIEM3210) and get the chance to also do this yourself. \n"

Note that this means that for 90% of the time, no significant transport occurs! The angle is quite small, but it simplifies our notebook and helps us make a comparison below between a numerical and analytical solution. In the analytical solution we assume small angles, such that we can approximate $\\sin2\\phi$ by $2\\phi$ (in rad!). We assume this approximation is valid as $-20°<2\\phi<20°$. With this knowledge, review the above question about the relative error in S due to this approximation!\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the angle $\\phi_0$ is defined as positive when it induces positive transport (to the right), the same as the image in Table 8.2 of the textbook. Thus, the stretch of coast we are looking at is the updrift side of the breakwater.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the initial, straight and undisturbed coastline, this wave condition leads to an alongshore yearly transport $S$, which we will compute shortly after. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial and boundary conditions\n",
    "We also need to impose initial and boundary conditions. These are thoroughly described by Equations 8.21 - 8.23. Briefly, for initial conditions, we assume a straight coastline (i.e $y=0$  along the coast). The following two boundary conditions are imposed:\n",
    "* $S_x = S$, for $x=-\\infty$ and for all $t$ (Equation 8.22)\n",
    "* $S_x = 0$, for $x=0$ and for all $t$ (Equation 8.23)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determine alongshore transport S\n",
    "Let's now determine the average yearly transport for the initial updrift coastline. Outside the influence of this breakwater the transport remains constant in time at $S$ (see the first  boundary condition above). We now calculate the transport as above, and convert it to $m^3/year$, taking the frequency of occurrence (10%) into account:"

    "### Discussion of numerical solution\n",
    "\n",
    "This numerical solution looks quite nice. You can verify the transport magnitude far away from the breakwater and at the breakwater from the boundary conditions and the above-computed value for the total yearly transport. Have a look at how the shoreline and transport changes over the years, and compare this to the more qualitative Figures 8.11 and 8.13 in the book. You can see that the development of the shoreline slows down in time. You can also see the difference between the initial transport at t = 0 and the transport after some time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could extend this model with all sorts of additional functionality. Perhaps a first step would be to include the down-drift zone into the model. You will learn all about this in the Coastal Modelling unit of CIEM3210! \n",
    "\n",
    "In the plot with the morphological evolution through time, we see that the angle the shoreline makes with the breakwater is fairly constant throughout the years. This is the angle that leads to zero alongshore transport for the given conditions at this location. Can you estimate the shoreline angle at the breakwater from the figure? Why did you find this value, and why it is constant in time? You can verify your answer in one of the questions below.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Accretion length and region of influence from numerical and analytical solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Above we have considered a simplified situation, for which the textbook also presents some analytical solutions, for 1) the accretion length $L(t)= 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\phi'St}{\\pi d}}$ at the breakwater, and 2) the region of influence of the breakwater $X = 2.5 \\sqrt{\\pi}\\frac{L}{\\phi'}$ (see Figure 8.12 and Equation 8.25). Note that the angle is in radians in these equations. Let's see how they compare with the numerical solution. In the first cell below we get the accretion length and region of influence for the modelled time. In the second cell, we calculate these same values analytically. Then in the third cell we plot both to compare. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the values from the numerical solution are influenced by a chosen threshold value of 0.01% of the accretion length at the breakwater at each time. This is the minimum accretion length before we count it as change. You can change it if you'd like and see how it affects the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the analytical computation of the accretion length and region of influence, we need $\\phi$', the angle of incidence at the closure depth of $d = 7$ m (see Equation 8.25). Here we will use $\\phi$'$≈ \\phi_0$, where $\\phi_0$ is a small angle, in line with the assumptions behind the analytical solution. We also need the yearly transport $S$ in the undisturbed zone (where the coastline still has its original orientation). We already computed this above as follows:\n",
    "$S$ (in m$^3$/s) = CERC($c_b$, 10, 1.2). Remember that the wave climate occurs 10% of the year. For 1 year, the contribution is: $S$ (in $m^3$/year) $= (0.1 * S) * 365.25 * 24 * 3600$."

    "## Part 3: Transport for a wave climate as a function of coastline orientation\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we plotted the ($S$,$\\phi$)-curve for a single wave condition only. We will now include multiple wave conditions and will determine the transport as a function of the coastline orientation. This will result in a different type of curve, as you will see. \n",
    "\n",
    "Such a curve generally underlies numerical coastline models. In such models, a full wave climate is often taken into account. Further, the transport is computed by changing the coastline orientation relative to the waves. First, the transport for the full climate is computed for the initial coastline orientation of zero. Then, the coastline orientation is changed a bit and the transport for the full climate is recomputed. This procedure for constructing a $S$-curve as a function of the coastline orientation is quite similar to constructing an ($S$,$\\phi$)-curve. The procedure is further explained in Intermezzo 8.2 in the textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now step through the example computations as shown in Intermezzo 8.2. We will use the condensed wave climate as presented in Table 8.2. Each wave height and offshore angle of incidence is associated with a period $T$ assumed to be 7 seconds. Following the above described procedure, we can plot the transport as a function of the *shoreline orientation*, recreating Figure 8.10.\n",
