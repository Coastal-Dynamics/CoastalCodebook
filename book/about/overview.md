=======================

For each of the eight weeks of the course, there are one or multiple notebooks available.

## Topics per notebook 

Name      | Topic |
| :---        |    :----   |
| 1a_tectonic_classification | on tectonic classification of coasts
| 1b_process-based_classification | on process-based classification of coast
| 2a_pre_knowledge_waves |  to test your knowledge on the dispersion relationship, not needed if you master your Waves course material
| 2b_wave_dispersion_and_grouping | practice a bit more with wave dispersion and study wave grouping (largely known from Waves, repeated in this week's lectures)
| 2c_generation_tide |  a review of the origin of the tide (differential pull of the sun and moon) as discussed in this week's reading material and lectures, handy if you find this a difficult topic
| 2d_tidal_constituents |  to get to know the tide, tidal propagation and tidal constituents
| 3a_tidal_environments |  discover the four different tidal environments
| 3b_wave_asymmetry_and_skewness |  recreate the figures in the book about skewed and asymmetric waves
|  3c_radiation_stresses_and_wave_forces |  cross-shore distribution of cross-shore and alongshore wave forces
| 4a_bound_long_wave |  understand the generation mechanism of the bound long wave
| 4b_shallow_water_tides |  discover overtides and compound tides in shallow water and learn about tidal analysis and prediction
| 5_coastal_classification_and_beach_states |  on process-based classification and beach states for Brazilian beaches 
| 6_cross_shore_transport |  on cross-shore sediment transport using velocity moments and shape functions
| 7_alongshore_transport |  on alongshore sediment transport featuring the CERC formula, $(S-\phi)$-curves and coastline modeling
| 8a_escoffier_curve | learn about inlet stability with the aid of the Escoffier curve
| 8b_kreeke_robaczewska |  investigate tide-induced residual sediment transport following Van de Kreeke and Robaczewska
| 8c_equilibrium_concentration |  get to know the difference between the equilibrium and lagged response of suspended sediment
| 8d_interventions |  explore various interventions and (human-induced) changes in tidal inlet/basin systems
