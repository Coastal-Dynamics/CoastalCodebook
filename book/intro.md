# Welcome to the Coastal Codebook 

Welcome to the Coastal Dynamics Open Codebook. The Coastal Codebook consists of a series of jupyter notebooks, supplementing the [Coastal Dynamics Open Textbook](https://books.open.tudelft.nl/home/catalog/book/202). The interactive exercises of the Coastal Codebook help students interact with and reflect on the textbook material.  

At TU Delft, The Coastal Textbook and Coastal Codebook supplement the MSc course Coastal and Estuarine Systems (CIEM3110-U1). This course discusses the interrelation between physical wave, flow, and sediment transport phenomena and the resulting morphodynamics of a wide variety of coastal systems. The objective is to provide insights into the phenomenological and theoretical as well as applied aspects for civil engineering MSc students.
