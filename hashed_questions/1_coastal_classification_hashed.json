Selecting a minimum depth of 33 km in the earthquake panel excludes the earthquakes at divergent boundaries. Note that the tectonic plates move away from each other at divergent boundaries. Magma wells up to (relatively) shallow depths in order to fill the gap. This causes earthquakes at these shallower depths.",

What is the minimum earthquake depth that you must select in the earthquake panel to exclude the divergent boundaries (try about 33, 74 and 140 km - the values mentioned in the answer options).
