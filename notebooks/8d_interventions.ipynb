    "# 8d: Interventions and natural changes\n",
    "\n",
    "You have reached the fourth and final notebook of week 8, which considers changes in the dynamic equilibrium of basins, due to interventions and natural changes. We are going to bring together many of the concepts covered in Chapter 9 to examine how natural changes and human interventions (like closing off part of the basin with a storm surge barrier) modify the morphology of tidal basins and their surrounding coastal systems. When a change occurs, the system may shift to a new equilibrium, which may result in a supply or demand of sediment. When the basin demands sediment, we talk about \"_sand hunger_\" or, in Dutch, \"_zandhonger_\"). The relative supply or demand will determine the impact on the rest of the coastal system. The most important concept is to be able to estimate how the relative supply or demand changes as the tidal prism, channels, and ebb-tidal delta change. These components are dynamically coupled in a sediment-sharing system. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains 1 coding exercise and thirteen multiple-choice and multiple-selection questions. It consists of the following parts:\n",
    "1. Equilibrium relationships for channels and ebb-tidal delta\n",
    "2. Closures\n",
    "3. Land reclamation\n",
    "4. Relative sea level rise\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this notebook, make sure you followed the lectures on Chapter 9 (or read the slides) and read Section 9.8 of the [Coastal Dynamics Open Textbook](https://books.open.tudelft.nl/home/catalog/book/202), which is on changes in dynamic equilibrium. "
