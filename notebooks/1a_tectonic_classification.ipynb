    "Welcome to the first week of notebook exercises for Coastal Systems (TU Delft, MSc Coastal Engineering)! This is the third year that we use notebooks in Coastal Systems. With these notebooks, we hope to support the [Coastal Dynamics Open Textbook](https://books.open.tudelft.nl/home/catalog/book/202) with interactive material that helps you better understand the coastal processes and concepts explained in this course. Please let us know how you like the notebooks - we appreciate your feedback!\n",
    "\n",
    "Each week of the course has at least 1 accompanying notebook. Some weeks may have multiple notebooks. This week, we will have 2 notebooks: notebooks 1a and 1b. These two notebooks are about the material in Chapter 2 of the [Open Textbook](https://books.open.tudelft.nl/home/catalog/book/202), which describes the large geographical variation of coasts across the world. This chapter explains how the coasts that we have today are shaped by both present-day processes and processes millions of years ago. It distinguishes between three different orders of features, which are associated with different orders of time. In the notebooks of this first week, we will look at coastal systems at these different orders of scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 1a starts with the broadest (or first-order) features of the coast that cover large geographical distances (thousands of kilometres) and are linked to the long-term geological process of plate tectonics. We will do so by using earthquake data from the [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/). The dataset that we load contains a sample (10\\%) of observed earthquakes between Dec 2018 and Jan 2000. Why earthquake data? Earthquake data could help reveal the geophysical processes on earth, which is not only insightful to geologists, but to coastal researchers as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will first prepare the visualization of the data. Next, you will be asked to answer 12 multiple choice or multiple selection questions."

Earthquakes occur in the crust or upper mantle, which ranges from the earth's surface to about 800 km deep. If you look very carefully, you might observe that according to the dataset, an unexpectedly high number of earthquakes occur at a depth of 10 km. Ten kilometres is a \"fixed depth\". Sometimes data are too scarce or low-quality to compute a reliable depth for an earthquake. In such cases, the depth is assigned to be 10 km ([source](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-depth-do-earthquakes-occur-what-significance-depth#:~:text=Ten%20kilometers%20is%20a%20%22fixed,assigned%20to%20be%2010%20km.)).

This behaviour relates to how the map data is stored and displayed, which is much more efficient for us to load, but with the unfortunate side effect that (at least in this case) the colourmap is not constant for all scales.\n",
