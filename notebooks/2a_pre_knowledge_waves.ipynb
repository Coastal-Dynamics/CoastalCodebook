    "*This is the first of four notebooks for this week, and the one that we hope you will skip!* Why? It contains basic instruction and exercise material for the dispersion relationship, which should be very familiar to you after having followed the Waves Unit. We have plenty of material to cover in Coastal Systems, so our advice would be to first move to Notebook 2b and *only* return to Notebook 2a if you cannot solve the questions in notebook 2b. In Notebook 2b you will *also* use the dispersion relationship, which should give you plenty of opportunity to refresh your knowledge and practice. \n",

For intermediate water however, the full relationships must be used (Eqs. 1). For known $h$ and wave length $L$ (or, equivalently, $k$), it is then still straightforward to find $\\omega$ (and the wave period $T$). However, generally $h$ and $T$ would be known instead, and we would end up with an implicit equation in $k$ or $L$. You can choose between three methods to solve this implicit equation:\n",
