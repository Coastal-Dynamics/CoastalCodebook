    "This notebook is the fourth of four notebooks accompanying Chapter 3 of the [Coastal Dynamics Open Textbook](https://books.open.tudelft.nl/home/catalog/book/202). It specifically addresses tidal constituents, tidal propagation and tidal prediction (see Sections 3.7.6 through 3.9 of the book and the corresponding slides). The notebooks explore these concepts in a more interactive way, with some exercises, visualizations, and code. There are also ten quiz questions included in this notebook. We will not repeat the whole theory, however, so make sure you have followed the lectures for this week and read the relevant pages in chapter 3 of the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earth has continents, oceans with varying water depths, and a complex gravitational field, hence the tidal signals we observe around the planet are complex. Fortunately, we can break them down into multiple harmonic components, called ***tidal constituents***. The principal harmonic components can either be diurnal, semi-diurnal, short-, or long-period constituents. Each constituent is characterized by an amplitude, frequency and phase, and individually looks like a smooth sin/cosine curve. When we sum up all the individual components we observe signal beating resulting in complex tidal signals with spring-neap cycles, daily inequalities, and longer-term variations.\n",

    "1. Tidal analysis and prediction (Part 1, 1 question)\n",
    "2. Beating of tidal constituents (Part 2, 5 questions)\n",
    "3. Tidal amplitude spectrum (Part 3, open questions to help you reflect)\n",

    "### Water level record and tide prediction for Scheveningen\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the tide is caused by regular astronomical phenomena, it can be predicted accurately a long time ahead (but note that this does not include meteorological effects such as storm surges!). The method used for tide prediction is harmonic analysis (see Section 3.9). By a combination of harmonic analysis and hydrodynamic modelling, tidal signals can be predicted for an arbitrary location. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the exercise, we compare the full observational sea level with a predicted tidal signal at Scheveningen. To achieve this, we will use two datasets:\n",
    "- [GESLA-3 (Global Extreme Sea Level Analysis)](https://gesla787883612.wordpress.com/) sea level records\n",
    "- [FES2014 Global Tide data](https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/products/auxiliary-products/global-tide-fes/description-fes2014.html), providing amplitude and phase information for 34 tidal constituents, distributed on 1/16Ëš grids.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The GESLA (Global Extreme Sea Level Analysis) data set contains high-frequency (at least hourly) sea-level information from tide gauge stations distributed worldwide. It can be used to analyse tides, storm surges, extreme sea levels and other related processes. The FES2014 is a global finite element hydrodynamic model, which assimilates in-situ data and altimeter data. It provided tidal elevations and tidal currents in terms of amplitudes and phases of 34 tidal components. These 34 tidal components include both astronomical components (like in the Table above) and the higher harmonics that are generated due to non-linear effects in shallowing coastal waters. We will explain more about these non-linear shallow water tides or overtides later, when treating Section 5.7.5 of the book. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first cell below creates a figure of the observed sea level from GESLA and the tidal signal from FES2014 for Scheveningen, the Netherlands. The figure helps you to see how the observed sea level from GESLA matches up with the tidal signal derived from the available 34 constituents. If you run the second cell below you get a question about this.\n",
    "\n",
    "About the figure:\n",
    "- We computed the tidal signal from the all 34 FES2014 constituents for a timeframe spanning from 1977 to 2017, using the [uptide](https://github.com/stephankramer/uptide) python package\n",
    "- In the code, we have chosen to visualize 2015 only, but you can change the code to present an arbitrary **timeframe** in the period from 1977 to 2017. \n",
    "- Note that you can easily adjust the view of the figure; you can not only **pan** (move the view) and **zoom**, but the two axes are individually zoomable as well by **hovering** over them and using the wheelzoom tool."
