            "correct": "Correct, the Para beaches indeed experience the largest tidal range. If you look at the satellite imagery, you will notice that their beaches tend to be wide with various intertidal features (ridges and runnels). Furthermore, if you zoom out even further, you will see that many of the Para beaches are surrounded by large funnel-shaped estuaries and deltas, which are suggestive of tide-dominated systems (see Chapter 2.7.3) You can also confirm the large tidal range in Figure 4.10 from the textbook. Also, check the grain diameter and beach slope for the Para beaches. What do you notice?",

MTR indicates the mean tidal range. You can make a direct quantitative comparison, but it is also worthwhile to consider: how might you be able to distinguish a site with a large tidal range based on satellite imagery alone?"

If you zoom out, you can see that Campo Bom is relatively less sheltered by headlands or islands, and is directly exposed to swells and storm waves from the South Atlantic and Southern Oceans. These contribute to its relatively high average wave height. The beaches in Brazil's northern states are generally exposed to milder tropical conditions.",
