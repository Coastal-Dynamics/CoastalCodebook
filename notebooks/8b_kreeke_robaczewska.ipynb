    "# 8b: Tide-induced residual transport (Van de Kreeke and Robaczewska)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the second notebook of week 8. In this notebook, we dive deeper into residual medium to coarse sediment transport induced by tidal asymmetry. For this analysis, we use the equations derived by [Van de Kreeke and Robaczewska (1993)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0077-7579(93)90022-K). Note that \"asymmetry\" is used here in the general definition, but we will see later that it is specifically asymmetry about the horizontal axis that leads to a residual transport of medium to coarse sediment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The approach of Van de Kreeke and Robaczewska is a quasi-steady approach. It starts from the assumption that the instantaneous transport by tidal currents, $S(t)$, is a function of the local depth-averaged velocity as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\tag{1}\n",
    "S(t) \\propto u(t) \\left|u(t)\\right|^2 \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the residual (i.e. tide-averaged) transport is proportional to the third odd velocity moment: $\\left\\langle S \\right\\rangle \\propto \\left\\langle u \\left|u\\right|^2\\right\\rangle$, with the angle brackets denoting tide-averaging. This is equivalent to the energetics-type bed load transport formula that we have seen in Chapters 6 and 7. The difference is now that the horizontal velocity is the tidal velocity rather than the short-wave orbital velocity. It is assumed that the sediment is medium to coarse ($u_*/w_s<1$), so that the sediment is predominantly moving as bed load. Considering sediment travelling in suspension introduces other complications, as we shall see in Notebook 8c. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you can practice with the Van de Kreeke and Robaczewska approach through interactive figures, questions and coding exercises. The notebook consists of the following two parts: \n",
    "1. Instananeous tidal velocity and transport (6 multiple-choice and multiple-selection questions)\n",
    "2. Residual transport in hypothetical estuary (two coding exercises and two multiple-choice questions)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this notebook, make sure you followed the lectures on Chapter 9 (or read the slides) and read Section 9.7.2 of the [Coastal Dynamics Open Textbook](https://books.open.tudelft.nl/home/catalog/book/202)."

    "## Part 1: Instantaneous tidal velocity and transport\n",
    "\n",
    "In their analysis, Van de Kreeke and Robaczewska considered several diurnal and semi-diurnal components as well as overtides and compound tides. Under the assumption of M2 dominance, they found that M4 and M6 are the most important constituents contributing to the long-term tide-averaged transport. Higher overtides also contribute, but their contributions are smaller and were neglected. The components K1, S2, N2 and MS4 were also considered, but these were found to only cause fluctuations of the transport rates that would average out in the longer term. Thus, we can restrict ourselves to the following tidal-current signal $u(t)$: \n",

    "To verify your answers, compare the last two colums of the above table. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the approximate Eq. 4 gives somewhat different values than Eq. 3, but the values are quite close. The difference is due to higher order terms that are neglected in Eq. 4. The advantage of Eq. 4 is that the decomposition in different terms is quite insightful. The largest contribution to the transport is due to the asymmetry introduced by the residual flow, as we can see from term 1 ($u_0$ and M2). This term gives a net transport in the direction of the residual flow, which is seaward here. The terms representing the effect of the overtides, term 2 (M2 and M4) and term 3 (M2, M4 and M6) have opposite directions! Term 2 contributes to a net seaward transport, but term 3 actually indicates a landward transport due to the triad interaction between the M2, M4 and M6 tidal velocities. The result of all three terms combined is an ebb-dominant residual transport. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** In our case $u_0$ is small (< 10% of $u_{M2}$), such that the assumption of M2 dominance is a reasonable assumption. However, when $u_0$ is not small relative to $u_{M2}$, more terms than the terms in Eq. 4 need to be taken into account for the residual transport.
