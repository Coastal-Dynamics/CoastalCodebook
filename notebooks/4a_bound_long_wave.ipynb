    "## Part 2: Bound long wave\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "In Notebook 3c, we have seen that the radiation stress gradients in the shoaling zone result in a set-down that increases towards the seaward edge of the surf zone. We found that this set-down depends on the wave height (see Section 5.5.4 and Equation 5.64 in the [Coastal Dynamics Open Textbook](https://books.open.tudelft.nl/home/catalog/book/202)). Due to *variation* of the wave height and radiation stresses in the groups, the set-down varies varies as well, being the largest under the highest waves. This results in a mean water level fluctuation on the scale of the wave group with the largest depression under the highest waves in the group. This is equivalent to a long wave motion, the so-called bound long wave, which is forced by the group and travels at the speed of this group (so $c_g$). For a perfect bound long wave, the phase-shift between the long wave and the short-wave envelope is $\\pi$ ; the wave trough of the bound long waves coincides with the maximum of the wave envelope and the wave crest coincides with the minimum of the wave envelope. This negative correlation changes to a positive correlation as the waves enter the surf zone. This can be understood from intermittent wave-breaking in the group, generating a time-varying set-up. See also Section 5.8.2 in the textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the bound long wave varies on the scale of the wave group, as the wave energy and radiation stress do. We can thus write for the bound long wave:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\tag{8}\n",
    "\\eta_b = \\hat\\eta_b \\cos (\\Delta\\omega t - \\Delta k x)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In here, the bound long wave surface elevation amplitude $\\hat\\eta_b$ must be *negative*. Can you see why?\n",
    "\n",
    "A formula for the bound long wave surface elevation amplitude for this situation was derived by Longuet-Higgens and Stewart (1962). It can be found as Eq. 3.134 in a Guide to Modeling Coastal Morphology by Dano Roelvink and Ad Reniers. It reads:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\tag{9}\n",
    "\\hat\\eta_b = \\frac{\\Delta k^2 ga^2 (2n-0.5)}{\\Delta \\omega^2-gh\\Delta k^2} = \\frac{-ga^2(2n-0.5)}{gh-\\frac{\\Delta \\omega^2}{\\Delta k^2}} = \\frac{-ga^2(2n-0.5)}{gh-c_g^2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Verify for yourself that Eq. (9) will indeed yield a negative value!\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's check whether Eqs. (8-9) make any sense. Do this by coding the bound long wave surface elevation. As before, you can code your function in the below code cell. By running this code cell, your code will automatically be checked and plotted in the figures, together with the correct answers. If you run the code cell without adjustments (so with \"None\" where your functions should appear), you will get a figure showing only the correct results.\n",
