    "# 3a: Tidal Environments\n",
    "  \n",
    "This week, we will have three notebooks: Notebooks 3a, 3b and 3c. Notebook 3a is about the tidal part of Chapter 4 of the [Coastal Dynamics Open Textbook](https://books.open.tudelft.nl/home/catalog/book/202), which treats the global variation of the main processes that shape the coast (wind, waves, and tides). Notebook 3b is about wave form (wave asymmetry and skewness) and will come in handy when studying both wind waves and tides and related sediment transport, from Chapter 5 onwards. Notebook 3c is about radiation stresses, which are crucial in generating wave-induced currents and water level variations. \n",

    "Tidal environments can be classified based on the following two variables: \n",
    "- *Magnitude* of the tide, characterised by the tidal range;\n",
    "- Tidal *character*, determined by the importance of diurnal vs. semi-diurnal components\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore both classifications using python code. The notebook consists of *three* parts with a total of *twenty-one* multiple-choice, multiple-selection or numeric questions (1 question in part 1, 12 questions in part 2 and 8 questions in part 3)."
