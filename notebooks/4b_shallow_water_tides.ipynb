    "# 4b: Shallow-water Tides\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the second of the two notebooks used this week. Building upon our analysis of tidal characters and main tidal constituents in previous weeks, it delves into the tidal part of Chapter 5 of the [Coastal Dynamics Open Textbook](https://books.open.tudelft.nl/home/catalog/book/202), where you gained insights into tidal propagation in coastal waters and higher harmonic tidal constituents. Our primary focus will be on ***shallow-water tides***,  explained in Section 5.7.5 of the textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "Besides the main tidal constituents - which have periods that can be explained from astronomical considerations - additional components with different periods occur in shallow water (shelf regions and coastal seas). These shallow-water tides, also known as ***overtides*** and ***compound tides***, are generated as a result of non-linear effects in shallow coastal waters and tidal basins. Compound tides (e.g. MS4) result from the shallow-water interaction between two parent constituents (M2 and S2). Overtides (e.g. M4) result from the interaction of a component with itself (M2 and M2). \n",
    "\n",
    "The periods of shallow-water tides partly overlap with astronomical tides (diurnal and semi-diurnal components) or have shorter periods that are integer fractions (1/2, 1/3, etc.) of the basic periods. The name overtides comes from the latter characteristic. We will not repeat the whole theory here, so make sure you followed these week's lectures and read the tidal parts of Chapter 3 and Chapter 5 of the textbook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the shorter period tides are (we will consider this selection of components in part 1):\n",
    "- M3: an *astronomical* terdiurnal tide, often quite unimportant \n",
    "- M2 higher harmonics: overtides M4, M6, M8\n",
    "- S2 higher harmonics: overtides S4, S6, S8\n",
    "- Tides generated by the interaction of different tidal components: compound tides MS4, MN4\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook outline\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In Part 1 of this notebook we will explore the above-listed tidal components. These are tidal constituents with shorter periods than the diurnal and semi-diurnal components we have seen in Notebooks 2d and 3a. Part 1 is accompanied by ***7 multiple-choice or multiple-selection questions***.\n",
    "2. In Part 2 we will introduce a method of obtaining the tidal signal and making tidal predictions. Here the challenge for you is to try and follow the computation procedure step-by-step. It may help to re-read Section 3.9 of the book, which is on Tidal Analysis and Prediction. There are no questions for this part.\n",

    "## Part 2: Tidal analysis, reconstruction & Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the tide is caused by regular astronomical phenomena, it can be predicted accurately a long time ahead (although not including meteorological effects such as storm surges). While we've utilized global model data from FES2014 in our previous analyses, it's important to note that the tidal signal at a particular location can also be derived from measured sea levels through harmonic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tidal analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the notebook, we will analyse the tidal signal obtained from the measured sea level. \n",
    "For this, we will use the [utide](https://github.com/wesleybowman/UTide/tree/master) Python package, which is a Python adaptation of the Matlab [UTide](https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46523-utide-unified-tidal-analysis-and-prediction-functions) package. It is a unified tidal analysis framework used for carrying out tidal analysis on a multi-year sequence of observations collected at irregularly spaced times. We will again use the [GESLA-3 (Global Extreme Sea Level Analysis)](https://gesla787883612.wordpress.com/) sea level records at Scheveningen.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Harmonic analysis and long-term constituents\n",
    "UTide performs a harmonic analysis as explained in Section 3.9 of the book; from a time series of water level data at a certain location, it computes the amplitudes and phases of tidal constituents with known frequencies; they are deterministic and predictable. The corresponding periods range from hours for the shallow-water tides to long-term astronomical components, like semi-annual and annual components Sa and SSa and the component with a period of 18.6 years. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the semi-annual and annual astronomical constituents Sa and SSa are insignificant for most applications, if one includes them in a yearlong harmonic analysis of water level data, their calculated values may come out much larger than would be expected from astronomical forcing. This is because meteorological semi-annual and annual effects on the water levels, like seasonal changes in wind, temperature and atmospheric pressure may show up in these constituents. However, these meteorological effects are not consistent from year to year; their variations from year to year are not predictable. For that reason, one could decide to not use the semi-annual and annual components that come out of a harmonic analysis. Here we take a different approach; we take a long enough time series (many years of data), such that we find constituent values that are more representative of a *long-term average* semi-annual and annual cycle. In our example, we need a minimum of 20 years of data for this (we will use 40 years, from 1977 to 2017), with the added benefit that also the component with a length of 18.6 years is included.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Computational time\n",
    "Of course, the choice of running Utide for a 40-year data series comes at the expense of computational cost. It is much cheaper to use a shorter data series. We have therefore pre-computed the phases and amplitudes for the 1977-2017 period. Instead of running Utide yourself, you can load these results. For reference, we do provide the script to make the Utide computation yourself (but we implore you to don't try a long time series on the server).\n",
    "\n",
    "The three cells below do the following:\n",
    "1. The first cell loads the Scheveningen GESLA data for 1953-2018\n",
    "2. The second cell loads the constituent values (phases and amplitudes) computed by Utide for the 1977-2017 period \n",
    "3. The third cell is commented out. It shows the code we used to generate the results loaded in the second cell. Take a close look at the code to see if you can make sense of the steps we took. Leave the cell uncommented, or, if you want to do a Utide computation yourself, please choose a small time period, e.g., a year."

Finally, these phase and amplitudes are used to reconstruct a time signal again, which approaches the de-trended signal we started off with, but is not exactly the same, as you can see from the yellow difference between the observed and reconstructed signal. Why is that?  \n",

We called this difference the so-called non-tidal residual. The non-tidal residual is the part of the sea level that remains once the tidal components have been removed. This primarily contains the meteorological contribution to sea level, often called the surge. However, it may also contain some non-linear interactions.\n",
