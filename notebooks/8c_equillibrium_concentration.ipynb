    "# 8c: Equilibrium concentration versus lag effects\n",
    "\n",
    "You have reached the third notebook of this week. As mentioned in the previous notebook, things get a little more complicated when we consider finer sediment travelling in suspension. Finer sediment takes relatively longer to settle, meaning that it does not respond instantaneously to the tidal flow and our quasi-steady assumption does not hold - we discussed this in Chapter 6. This makes estimating fine sediment concentrations a bit more challenging. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook consists of two parts. In the first part, we will recreate Figure 9.32 of the [Coastal Dynamics Open Textbook](https://books.open.tudelft.nl/home/catalog/book/202). This part contains **three** coding exercises and **five** multiple-choice and multiple-selection questions. You will amongst others: \n",
    "- Consider the *equilibrium concentration*. This is the concentration that would be reached if the sediment is able to instantaneously adjust to the time-varying tidal current\n",
    "- Include a *lag effect*, which represents that fine sediment concentrations not only depend on the instantaneous flow conditions, but on the conditions upstream and in the past as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part of the notebook, you can explore the effect of using different parameter values using an interactive figure. With this figure, you can create alternatives to Figure 9.32 with different settings of some of the important parameters. To help you interpret the effect of the various settings, this part comes with **six** multiple-choice and multiple-selection questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this notebook, make sure you followed the lectures on Chapter 9 (or read the slides) and read Section 9.7.3 of the book, which is on fine sediment transport and siltation. Specifically, study Figure 9.32 in the book, since we are going to reproduce that figure in this notebook!"
