# Coastal Dynamics Open Codebook

Welcome to the Coastal Dynamics Open Codebook. The Coastal Codebook consists of a series of jupyter notebooks, supplementing the [Coastal Dynamics Open Textbook](https://books.open.tudelft.nl/home/catalog/book/202). The interactive exercises of the Coastal Codebook help students interact with and reflect on the textbook material.

At TU Delft, The Coastal Textbook and Coastal Codebook supplement the MSc course Coastal and Estuarine Systems (CIEM3110-U1). This course discusses the interrelation between physical wave, flow, and sediment transport phenomena and the resulting morphodynamics of a wide variety of coastal systems. The objective is to provide insights into the phenomenological and theoretical as well as applied aspects for civil engineering MSc students.

For those interested in the set-up of this course, please have a look at the [course structure](./docs/about/course_structure.md) and overview of the [topics per notebook](./docs/about/notebook_overview.md). We also provide our students with weekly quizzes. Soon, this Coastal Quizbook will also be launched as open education tool.

## Usage

Detailed usage instructions are provided in the following documents:

1. [Installation instructions](./docs/usage/installation_codebook.md): a step-by-step guide to set up your coastal computing environment
2. [Getting started](./docs/usage/getting_started.md): this guide will help you get up and running with the course notebooks using JupyterLab, assuming youâ€™ve already installed the necessary software as per our [installation instructions](./docs/usage/installation.md).
3. [Troubleshooting](./docs/usage/troubleshooting.md)

## For the development team only

For use within TU Delft, the Codebook runs on a TU Delft [Jupyter hub](https://coastal.citg.tudelft.nl/codebook/hub).

Detailed instructions are provided in the following documents:
1. [Deployment](./docs/private/deployment.md): to deploy or update notebooks, follow these steps.
2. [Updating the database](./docs/private/update_database.md): to update the database on the hub

## Questions

If you have a question about the installation process or notebooks, feel free to open an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Coastal-Dynamics/CoastalCodebook). If
that's your first time, have a look at [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue). We choose to use the GitHub issue-tracker because your fellow students probably have similar problems. We will probably not troubleshoot the tutorial notebooks by email!
