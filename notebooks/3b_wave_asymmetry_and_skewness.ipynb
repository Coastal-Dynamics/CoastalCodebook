    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is one of the three notebooks for this week. It deals with wave shape, which is very important for sediment transport (as we will see in later chapters). When talking about wave shape, we can distinguish between wave skewness and wave asymmetry (Section 5.3 of the [Coastal Dynamics Open Textbook](https://books.open.tudelft.nl/home/catalog/book/202)). We will investigate these topics in this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "Wave asymmetry and skewness can be demonstrated by using a second-order wave with surface elevation $\\eta$ that consists of a first harmonic $\\eta_1$ and a second harmonic $\\eta_2$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\tag{1}\n",
    "\\eta = a_1 cos(wt-kx-\\phi_1) + a_2 cos(2(wt-kx)-\\phi_2)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare this equation to Equation 5.21 in the book; as you can see Equation 1 uses $a_1$ and $a_2$ for the amplitudes of the two harmonics (instead of $\\hat{\\eta}_1$ and $\\hat{\\eta}_2$). Also, we have added the phases $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$ of the components to Equation 1. For $\\phi_1=\\phi_2=0$, you will recognize a second-order Stokes wave. A phase *difference* between the wave components influences the shape of the combined wave. In Chapter 9 (Section 9.7.2), we will see that phase shift of the second harmonic with respect to the first harmonic is $\\phi_{2-1}=\\phi_2-2\\phi_1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for demonstration purposes, we have assumed that the first and second harmonic travel at the same speed, and, thus, that we have a permanent wave form. How can you see from Equation 1 that the second harmonic travels at the same speed as the first harmonic?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure\n",
    "This notebook consists of two parts: \n",
    "1. Investigate the wave shape of skewed and asymmetric waves using a primary and secondary harmonic. This part includes *six numeric questions*. \n",
    "2. Investigate the effect of wave skewness and asymmetry on wave-averaged quantities, including sediment transport. This part includes *three multiple-selection questions*\n"

    "### Figures 5.14 and 5.17\n",

    "Later in this course, we will consider how the wave shape influences sediment transport. A common assumption is that sediment transport is proportional to higher powers of the orbital velocity signal. As a first step, let us consider what higher powers of the surface elevation look like. Remember that under a progressive wave (like we see in the nearshore), velocity and surface elevation are in phase. Here we compare $\\eta$ with $\\eta^3$, while varying the phase of the second harmonic component, as in Figure 5.14 and 5.17. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Reflection\n",
    "Study the figures to see how the peaks and shape of $\\eta$ and $\\eta^3$ vary between the panels. What is the influence on the *phase-averaged value* of $\\eta^3$ when the amplitudes and phases of the wave components change? And as a final thought provoking question on this section: what may be the implications for the corresponding time-varying transport signal and the wave-averaged (or net or time-averaged) transport at a certain location? Verify your ideas using the questions below the graph."
