Introduction
=======================

The interactive exercises of the Coastal Codebook are meant to be used alongside the Coastal Textbook and aim to enhance your understanding of the textbook material. We therefore advise to work on these notebooks while studying the Coastal Textbook. 

## TU Delft students
We recommend to work on the notebooks during your weekly self-study time. We will also try to connect to the notebooks in the lectures of the course. During the Friday tutorials, which are guided by the teaching assistants, you can continue to work on the notebooks. So make sure you bring your questions about the notebooks (and any other content-related questions) to the tutorials.
